        <h2>How "What's the Bida?" Came to Be</h2>
        <p>After constant cycles of wanting hangouts but never knowing what to do, the idea of finding businesses and events, and informing the public about every find was something that
            appealed to us all. Eventually, the ideas became actions, and a new Instagram account named "What's the Bida?" came to be. Together, we collaborated with businesses and stayed up-to-date with important 
            events happening in the CNMI, and helped reach many businesses and local events reach the CNMI audience.
